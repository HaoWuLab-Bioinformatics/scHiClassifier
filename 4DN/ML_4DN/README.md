## Overview
1. This folder holds the code for evaluating the effectiveness of three machine learning methods, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for classification on the current dataset.  
2. The file "**combo_hg19.genomesize**" includes the lengths of each of the 23 chromosomes in a human cell, with the unit of measurement being the number of base pairs contained in the chromosome.
3. The file "**LR.py**" contains the code for evaluating the effectiveness of the machine method Logistic Regression (LR) for classification with the current dataset.
4. The file "**RF.py**" contains the code for evaluating the effectiveness of the machine method Random Forest (RF) for classification with the current dataset.
5. The file "**SVM.py**" contains the code for evaluating the effectiveness of the machine method Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification with the current dataset.
6. The file "**Machine_learning.py**" contains the declarations of certain functions and classes invoked by the "**LR.py**", "**RF.py**" and "**SVM.py**".
7. The folder "**test_result**" is used to store the evaluation results of three machine learning methods.

## Usage 
### Step 1. Training, Testing, and evaluation of the Logistic Regression
We need to run the "**LR.py**" to complete the training, testing, and evaluation of the Logistic Regression. And the evaluation results will be stored in the subfolder "**test_result**".
### Step 2. Training, Testing, and evaluation of the Random Forest
We need to run the "**RF.py**" to complete the training, testing, and evaluation of the Random Forest. And the evaluation results will be stored in the subfolder "**test_result**".
### Step 3. Training, Testing, and evaluation of the Support Vector Machine
We need to run the "**LR.py**" to complete the training, testing, and evaluation of the Support Vector Machine. And the evaluation results will be stored in the subfolder "**test_result**".
